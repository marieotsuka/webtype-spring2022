## Artist Websites
> “Aside from those working directly on digital culture – creating websites, apps, and videos meant to be experienced on a computer or mobile device – few artists today think about their websites as exhibition platforms, when in fact an artist’s website allows for an inordinate amount of freedom and experimentation to present that work to its best advantage to a wide audience. It is also a rare space in which artists can control the way their work is presented.” *—Orit Gat*

## Week 2

* complete basic character set 
* begin developing website for font-in-use specimen
* consider the following questions for your typeface:
  - how does the font take advantage of its mode of construction?
  - how can not only the shapes of the letters, but the actual transformation itself become part of your concept?
  - how can your typeface demonstrate a commentary; a point of view?
* consider the following questions for your website:
  - how is your axis of variation activated by the web?
  - what should it respond to?
    - is it user input? a browser width change? external data? time? sound?
    - what is the significance of this “response” in combination with the text that we see?

## Week 3

* refine and finalize typeface
  - are there other variants to consider
* flesh out your website specimen
  - what is the journey created through the website?
  - how can you showcase different components of your typeface?
  - what typeface are you pairing with your typeface? (since most of you are drawing display faces, you may want to consider selecting a text face to match your font)
* design the responsive version
  - use `@media` queries to make a mobile-friendly version
  - how does your typography adapt to the smaller screen?
* consider expanding what and how you’re curating your content: use JavaScript, JSON and / or APIs to enhance the experience of your typeface on the web

## Week 4
* refine website specimen
  - what kind of experience are you taking your visitor through with your website?
  - how does each design choice — typesize, color, motion — align with the concept?
  - finalize interactivity of the website — what is intuitive vs. what requires instructions?
  - finalize typographic details
  - finalize responsive behavior
  - consider a page or footer that contextualizes the project ("about section")
* ~~Final Crit: March 19~~
* Final Crit: April 2
