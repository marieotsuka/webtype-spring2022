This course will be offered on a hybrid model. We will conduct workshops and larger group critiques <span class="in-person">in-person</span>, with smaller group or individual crits and screen-based technical exercises remotely over [Zoom](https://risd.zoom.us/j/97883162532). Regardless of the modality, we will begin each class meeting together for a discussion of the weekâ€™s reading and to exchange any new discoveries. 
(Readings and materials are subject to change.)
