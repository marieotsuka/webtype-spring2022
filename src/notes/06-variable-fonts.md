For our variable font project, we will be using [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/), since RISD provides a site license for this software. Glyphs has some robust [tutorials](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials) as well as an active [forum](https://forum.glyphsapp.com/), which may be useful in your research.

Below are some key terms we will be using in type design.

* Begin with the Glyphs tutorial on [Multiple Masters](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/multiple-masters-part-1-setting-up-masters).
* See also [pixel font tutorial](https://glyphsapp.com/learn/pixelfont)

## Terms

**Design Space**
The range of design variations belonging to one type family.

**Master**
A set of drawn characters. Every typeface needs to have at least one master. When drawing a typeface, you are usually drawing a master.
  - The number of masters will determine the **design space**
  of the typeface.

**Instance**
A specified slice within the design space of the typeface. 
  - Masters are usually also instances, but not necessarily.
  - The type designer determines how many instances will be interpolated from the given masters.

**Interpolation**
The process of programmatically generating instances in-between masters.

**Node**
Any specified point of your glyph. Nodes can be either on-curve or off-curve.
  - A node along the path is called an **Oncurve** point
  - A node off the edge of a path, serving as an endpoint of a handle connected to an oncurve node is called an **Offcurve** point

## Interpolation

The [Noordzij Cube](https://www.typeroom.eu/content/watch-erik-van-blokland-explain-how-noordzij-cube-revolutionized-typeface-design) as an iconic visualization for interpolation and design space.

In order for a glyph to interpolate across masters, it needs [compatible outlines](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/multiple-masters-part-2-keeping-your-outlines-compatible), which means satisfying the following conditions.

**number of paths**
all masters have the same amount of paths, nodes and handles, as well as components

**path order**
all components, paths, nodes and handles are in the same order across all masters. 

**within a path**
Make sure the *triangular node*, which marks the first node, is in the same location for each path across masters. I recommend choosing a specific corner to be consistent (for example, the node that is that the bottom left of the glyph.) To change the first node, right click the node and select *Make Node First*. 

**within a glyph**
Make sure the order of the paths are in the same order. Go to *Filter* > *Fix compatibility* to view the order of your shapes.

**anchors**
all masters have the same set of anchors (Anchors are used to generate diacritic marks. We will not be using anchors for the scope of our project.)

**off-curve compatibility**
avoid off-curves that intersect with each other: keep in mind the invisible triangle formed by your point structures

## Variable Fonts
A single font file contains many different variations of a typeface, instead of having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style. This format was developed in collaboration by Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

### Advantages of variable fonts
- Font loading
	- HTTP requests
	- KB of data (depends on character set and design space)
- Purer expression of type design process
- Options

### Disadvantages of variable fonts
- Lack of support

## Variable Fonts and CSS
The properties of variable fonts can be set by CSS, as with any other CSS property. You can serve a variable font in the same way [as any other typeface](/notes/02-css/#typefaces); although currently there are still few commercially available variable fonts. 

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Magmatic';
  src: url('../fonts/magmatic-vf.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
}

p{
  font-family: 'Magmatic', sans-serif;
  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 300,'wdth' 120, 'XHGT' 100; ðŸ‘ˆ
}
```

The `font-variation-settings` is the CSS propety for variable fonts. - Values for multiple axes, are separated by `,`
- Each axes is in in between `''`, with the value after it
- Standard axes for variation are in lowercase,  custom axes are in uppercase.

### Standard (registered) axes
|syntax| description | Non-VF equivalent 
|---|---| ---
|wght| weight | `font-weight` 
|wdth| width | `font-stretch`
|opsz| optical sizing | `<font></font>-optical-sizing`
|ital| italicization | `font-style: italic` 
|slnt| slant | `font-style: oblique ` 

- Read a [caveat for italics](https://rwt.io/typography-tips/getting-bent-current-state-italics-variable-font-support)

## Spacing

If you did not draw a monospace / grid font, you will most likely need to space your glyphs. The overall flow of spacing is as follows:

- Space the control characters, `H` and `O` for uppercase, `n` and `o` for lowercase.
- Space the other characters to be evenly spaced in between these control characters 
- `D` would be spaced by viewing the string `HHDHOHODOO`
- `d` would be spaced by viewing the string `hhdohodoo`

Check out Cyrus Highsmithâ€™s Spacing Manual (sent via Slack) for more detailed instructions on spacing.


## Tools

While Glyphs App has a lot of built-in features, there are a lot small custom  tools that can help supplement the drawing process. See more about [extending Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/learn/extending-glyphs)

All scripts you can execute in Glyphs are located in your `/Users/[yourusername]/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts` folder. You can navigate directly there by clicking `Go > Go to Folder` in your Finder window.

After copying any scripts into that folder, hold down the `Option` key and click `Script > Reload Scripts` (Cmd-Opt-Shift-Y) to refresh your menu.

You can then tie your Scripts to keyboard shortcuts for easy access.
