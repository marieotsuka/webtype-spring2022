## Resizing Windows
In this exercise, you will take the layouts you created in last week’s exercise, and make them respond to the window size.

### Technical Notes
- [Responsive Layouts](/notes/04-responsive/)

### 1. You should have an understanding of the following components of responsive design:
- meta tag
- fluid layout 
- relative units
- fluid images
- media queries

### 2. Class Site Organization
If you haven’t done so yet, be sure to organize your class site repository and upload a live link to your exercise layout.
Then, make a new folder for this current exercise, and duplicate your files from last week’s layout [exercise](/exercises/01-layouts-positioning/) into it.

### 3. Adapt your layouts
For each of your layouts, apply the above principles to create a layout that adapts to various window widths, including mobile (less than 500px wide). You must have at least one `@media` rule.

Make a link to your mobile layouts from your class site.

Bonus: Add a `@media print` query that specifies formatting for the printed website. Export this preview as a PDF and link it from your class site.
