## Typesetting
In this in-class exercise, you will take a single image and some text, and develop 3 different layouts.

Pull the latest code into the `webtype-demos` repo via Github Desktop, and copy over the files from `week2` folder into your own repository, in a folder called `layout-exercise`.

- You may want to review some of this weekâ€™s suggested tutorials before diving in
- See [layouts](/notes/03-layouts/) for technical notes

### 1. Optimize your assets for web
- Optimize the image `circle-of-fifths-scale.jpg` for web use, at a maximum of 500px wide
- Consider the appropriate file format to save it

### 2. Markup the text with semantic HTML
- Use the text in `seven-principles.txt` to markup in HTML

### 3. Organize your elements to recreate the following layouts
- Add CSS styling to create 2 different versions
- Choose two from the below three layout options
- It may benefit you to reuse (at least some) of the html from other layouts
- Keep your layouts in their own respective folders for easier management
