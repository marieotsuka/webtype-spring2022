## :Hover Experiments

In today’s exercise, we will explore the concept in-between-ness through interpolation and CSS transitions / animations applied via `:hover`. Apply to them to your modular letterforms created last week.

### Technical Notes
- [Transitions and Animations](/notes/07-transitions-animations/)

1. Duplicate your existing master for your modular type
2. Adjust this new layer to reflect a second “state” of your typeface, keeping your outlines compatible for interpolation
3. Export your typeface as a variable font
4. Activate your variation axis via a hover effect, and begin experimenting with CSS transitions and animations
