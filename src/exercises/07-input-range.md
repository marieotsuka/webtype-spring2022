## Programmatically use your typeface

In today’s exercise, we will be diving a little bit further into JavaScript to control our variable fonts in the browser.

Review the [Code Lab Tutorial](https://github.com/risd-web/webtype-demos/tree/master/in-class-demos/week7) on JS and Variable Fonts, along with the [Panopto recording](https://risd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=354d95e4-8a96-4ae9-8b0f-ad1001236c9d). (I recommend viewing the video at `1.5×` or `2×` its actual speed.) As a reminder, you can continue to pull demo codes for in-class exercises by syncing the entire [Web Type Demos](https://github.com/risd-web/webtype-demos) repository to your computer.

Using what you learned from your tutorial, add on your *class site* with your variable font.

1. Similary to the way we set up Dark Mode, add a button that toggles states of your typeface.

2. Add an input slider that updates the `font-variation-settings` of your typeface.
