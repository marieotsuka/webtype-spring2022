This is the class website for Web Type at RISD, Spring 2022 with Marie Otsuka. It is a work in progress.

The site structure and materials are influenced by the work of [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/), [Minkyoung Kim](http://minkyoungkim.com/home/), [Chris Hamamoto](http://chrishamamoto.com/), and previous iterations RISD’s GD for the Web, Wintersession Web Design, and Web Progamming classes. <!-- Special thanks to [Kelsey Elder](https://www.carefulcursivedesign.com/) for sharing his materials on type design and technology. -->

The primary typeface used is <a href="https://occupantfonts.com/articles/design/monospace-in-motion/" targeet="_blank">Pentameter Variable</a>, designed with the spirit of the class in mind: creative coding. Although a monospace, it draws from characteristics of handwriting traditionally found in italic forms, making a mechanical and clunky script. 

The site is a static site generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and the full code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/marieotsuka/webtype-spring2022/), hosted on a GreenGeeks server.

The website will evolve as we progress through our class — please check back often for up to date resources.
