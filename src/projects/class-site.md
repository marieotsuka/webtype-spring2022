Your class site will serve as documentation for all of your work this semester. 

Design and develop a webpage that provides a link to each project and exercise. This index page will serve as a homepage for this class. You might also include alternate drafts / planning documents that you experimented before developing the final version of your website. (Links to Figma are great, but please do not link to any working documents such as `.psd` or `.ai` files as they can be too heavy.)

As you organize / reorganize your Github repository, make sure to double check that all links, including assets such as fonts and images, are properly linked.
