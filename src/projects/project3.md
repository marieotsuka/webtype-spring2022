With our functioning variable fonts, we’ll now create a specialized web page that highlights the features of the website. This website may not necessarily be *about* the typeface, but featuring content that is best expressed with your font and its axis of variation. 

## Project Details
Create a “type specimen” that creates a world for your typeface to live in.

### Technical Learnings
- How do you use variable fonts on the web?
- How might you use CSS and JavaScript to activate them?
- How might we use animation capacities?

### Design Questions
- How can we design around axes of variation?
- How does a transformative

## Project Schedule

### Week 1: Sketch out 2 directions for your type specimen {#week-1}
- If your typeface is a display face, consider pairing another typeface for captions and small text
- What is the journey created through the website?
- How can you showcase different components of your typeface?

### Week 2: Prototype {#week-2}
- Begin experimenting with JavaScript
- How does the interactive experience align with the concept of the site?

### Week 3: Refine
- Make your specimen responsive: how does your typography adapt to the smaller screen?
- How does each design choice — typesize, color, motion — align with the concept?
- Consider the interactivity of the website — what is intuitive vs. what requires instructions?
- Refine typographic details
- If you don’t have one yet, consider a page, secction, or footer that contextualizes the project ("about section")
- Consider expanding what and how you’re curating your content: use JavaScript, JSON and / or APIs to enhance the experience of your typeface on the web
