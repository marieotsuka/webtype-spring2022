title: "Typeface as Medium (P2) "

> “ ... in any context, large or small, designing the medium is managing the potentials and relationships between objects, the activity or disposition immanent in their organization.” – Keller Eastering


In this project, you will create a variable font, considering the axes of variation as a medium. You are not only designing the visual instances of letterforms — you are designing the relationship with the typographer (or anyone who uses the font.) What power and possibilities are you granting with your variable font? If you can choose [any kind of axes](https://v-fonts.com/) for variation, what is the significance of that choice?

You will then create a type specimen as a website that showcases your concept behind your variable font, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* How does the typography and interactive states express the theme of the events and the spirit of the community?
* What information might be important to include for its audience?

### Learning Outcomes

* Experiment with prototyping fonts containing variation axes
* Understand how to work with variable fonts on the web
* Consider how interactivity and participation in the design process
* Leverage the digital nature of the typeface to produce a generative design
* Introduction to JavaScript

### Requirements

* You must have a complete alphabet of either lowercase and uppercase, with punctuation indicated below.
* You must have 2 masters

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ or
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

“”.!?,-
```

## Project Schedule


### Step 1: Propose a concept

- define your typographic concept(s) — roughly sketch 3 different approaches
- determine the scope of your font
	- you might work from an existing design — something you’ve designed in the past 
	- if starting a new design, consider a modular approach
- articulate the *axis for variation* as an intentional design space
- begin with the control characters: H, O, D, n, o, p.
  - These characters provide the “DNA” of a typeface: its straight shapes, its curved shapes, and the combination of the two.


### Step 2: Drawing

- begin drawing one of your variable font concepts in Glyphs
- flesh out the basic alphabet for one master
- begin drafting your second master and test out your interpolation


### Step 3: Drawing Refinement, Design planning

- refine your drawing and complete both the character sets for both of your masters, making sure they interpolate
- begin rough concept sketches in Figma for your font-in-use website specimen
- consider the following questions for your *typeface*:
  - how does the font take advantage of its mode of construction?
  - how can not only the shapes of the letters, but the actual transformation itself become part of your concept?
  - how can your typeface demonstrate a commentary; a point of view?
- consider the following questions for your *website specimen*:
  - how is your axis of variation activated by the web?
  - what should it respond to?
    - is it user input? a browser width change? external data? time? sound?
    - what is the significance of this “response” in combination with the text that we see?


### Step 4: Prototype Development

- refine and finalize typeface
- prototype your website specimen
  - what is the journey created through the website?
  - how can you showcase different components of your typeface?
  - if your typeface is a display face, consider pairing another typeface for captions and small text
- begin experimenting with JavaScript
  - how does the interactive experience align with the concept of the site?


### Step 5: Prototype Refinement
* refine website specimen
  - what kind of experience are you taking your visitor through with your website?
  - how does each design choice — typesize, color, motion — align with the concept?
  - finalize interactivity of the website — what is intuitive vs. what requires instructions?
  - finalize typographic details
* design the responsive version
  - use `@media` queries to make a mobile-friendly version
  - how does your typography adapt to the smaller screen?
* consider a page or footer that contextualizes the project ("about section")
* optional: consider expanding what and how you’re curating your content: use JavaScript, JSON and / or APIs to enhance the experience of your typeface on the web
