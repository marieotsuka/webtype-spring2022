Common errors to watch out for when troubleshooting:

## HTML
* Are your HTML elements wrapped in open and close tags?
* Are your HTML elements properly nested?
* Do your attribute values have quotation marks around them?
* Are your directory paths correct? Double check your link syntax.

## CSS
* Do you have opening and closing brackets?
* Does your property and value pairs have colons in between them?
* Do you have a semicolon at the end of each declaration?
* Are your class / id names properly spelled, in the right case?

## General good practices
* Make sure you are working with files in the desired folder location. To move a folders/files, make sure to save and close out of them in your text editor first, then reopen after moving the file. (If you keep your file open in your text editor and try to save, it might try resave in the original location.)
* Use all lowercase and hyphens instead of spaces when naming files
* Always have your inspector handy
