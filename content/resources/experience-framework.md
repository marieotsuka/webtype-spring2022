The “5Es of Experience Design” provides a framework to curate and design experiential work. It helps us consider some guiding questions:
- How would you like people to move through the experience?
- How can you attract them and keep them engaged?

1. Entice
    - How are visitors invited to participate?
    - How are they invited to the space in the first place?
1. Enter
    - What is the threshold moment where a visitor transitions from their world to yours?
1. Engage
    - How do visitors interact? How do they know how to interact?
    - How do they engage with one another?
1. Exit
    - How do visitors know when they are done? 
1. Extend
    - How do guests continue to participate? 
    - Is there a take-home or social opportunity?

*Closing the circle*: This cycle can span an entire event, a whole space, or just a single piece of an interaction.
