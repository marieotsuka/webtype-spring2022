This is the class website for Web Type at RISD, Spring 2022 with Marie Otsuka. It will be updated closer to the beginning of the spring semester.

<!-- It is running in tandem with CCA’s [Interactive 1](http://interactive.htmlkitchen.net/), a class developed in collaboration with [Chris Hamamoto](http://chrishamamoto.com/), and the site structure and materials are in dialogue with this class. It is influenced by the work of [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/), [Minkyoung Kim](http://minkyoungkim.com/home/), and previous iterations RISD’s GD for the Web, Wintersession Web Design, and Web Progamming classes. Special thanks to [Kelsey Elder](https://www.carefulcursivedesign.com/) for sharing his materials on type design and technology.

The primary typeface used is an unreleased variable typeface (name to be determined) designed with the spirit of the class in mind: creative coding. Although a monospace, it draws from characteristics of handwriting traditionally found in italic forms, making a mechanical and clunky script. Your browser default `monospace` font is used for code. 

The site is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the full code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/marieotsuka/webtype-spring2021/), hosted on a GreenGeeks server.

The website will evolve as we progress through our class — please check back often for up to date resources. -->
