> “My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.” – Laurel Schwulst


In this project, you will create a single-serve site as an events archive for a community you care about. You might document real past events for an existing organization; alternatively, you might define some ideal speculative events that may not have happened yet.
 
In this process, you will develop an expressive typographic identity system for your events archive. This system will play out in various compositions within the page — each containing different content types. We will experiment with ways to activate the typography through the browser.

* How does the typography and interactive states express the theme of the events and the spirit of the community?
* What information might be important to include for its audience?

### Learning Outcomes

* Develop skills for typographic display on the screen
* Work with variations on a theme, balancing consistency and contrast
* Experiment and expand the range of typographic expression, including scale variation, typefaces choice, hover-states
* Fluency in CSS for laying out of text content
* Fluency in CSS positioning, transformations

### Requirements

* Each section should be at minimum 100vw x 100vh 
* Designs should be primarily typographic


## Project Schedule

### Step 1: Typographic Identity and Design

First, let’s collect the content for your site. Whether you are researching real events, or creating speculative events, or collecting resources, define the text for the following:

1. Landing section
- This feels like the “cover” of your book — consider this section as an opening expressive graphic event

2. Schedule / Listing
- How might you design a list of these records? 
- Document the details of at least 6 records related to your community, each as its own "web poster".
	- Each must have: Title, Description
	- Events may include Date / time / location; resources might inlude link / authors / published date
	- Think critically about your meta data — think of how the information you’re presenting aligns with the content of your site
- What is the appropriate hiearchy of information for these events? What is the default order?

3. About 
- What is the background information behind the community and this website?

Second, begin sketching out your typographic choices for the design of your site: determine a rouugh draft for each content type (landing, listing detail, and about area.) Make at least three different iterations. Feel free to use Figma, Sketch, illustrator, or your tool of choice.

* Post links to your Content document as well as your Figma files from your class site.


### Step 2: Prototype in Code

Prototype your content into HTML & CSS, with carefule attention to the way you structure and “chunk” together your code.

### Step 3: Refine your prototype, add interactivity

As you refine your prototype, consider ways to enhance your typography with interactivy. Consider it not as a decorative element, but rather something that encourages certain activities in the browser, or a temporal element that aligns with the concept of the site.
