Your class site will serve as documentation for all of your work this semester. 

Develop a single webpage that provides a link to each project and exercise, as well as your presentation. This index page will serve as a homepage for this class. You might also include alternate drafts / planning documents that you experimented before developing the final version of your website. As you organize / reorganize your Github repository, make sure to double check that all links, including assets such as fonts and images, are properly linked.
