To familiarize ourselves with HTML and CSS, we’re going to dive into the code of existing websites, and “hack” them.
Your most helpful tool in coding is going to be the “Inspector.” Learning to use this tool will provide key insights into how your browser is reading the HTML/CSS that you write.

In this exercise, we’ll be using Google Chrome for its inspector tools. Firefox and Safari also have this function available as well, but the Chrome inspector has many useful features.

Don’t worry about breaking anything! What you see in your browser is just your version of HTML that is displayed at that time. Messing with things with the inspector won’t change anything other site visitors will see. If you want to start over, simply refresh the page.

We’ll do this short exercise in pairs.

Provide a text-based website you think is lacking in typographic styles to your partner.
Using the Inspector, “hack” into the existing website to modify and improve its typography.
See if you can look up CSS properties to adjust and fine-tune the typography; even override fonts.
After 15min, take a screenshot and share your results with your partner, and place a link to it from your class website.

Consider the following CSS properties:

```CSS
font-family, font-weight, font-style, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, text-indent, margin, padding
```
