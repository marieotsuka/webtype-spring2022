As an exercise in making form with CSS, we’ll construct (at least) three letters in CSS. Start with the letters `n` `o` and `d` and try to express them as `div` elements in CSS.

Be deliberate with the positioning of your shapes, and experiment with CSS properties such as: `border, border-radius, transform, overflow` 
- when absolutely positioning elements, be sure to wrap the group in a `position: relative` so that the positioning is relative to the letter, instead of the whole document

This exercise lends itself to 2 approaches. You can view some code for simplified examples of each in the [week-3](https://github.com/risd-web/webtype-demos/tree/master/week-3) demos repository.

### A grid-based approach

This is how you might make pixel-type: determine a grid upon which you’ll place shapes to “fill out” a letter.

### A shape-based approach

Construct divs for “pieces” or “strokes” of your letter — either with shapes that represent a stem / bowl or with a modular stroke.
