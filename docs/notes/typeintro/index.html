	<h1>Introduction to Type</h1>
	<blockquote>
<p>“By writing directly into a mechanical form rather than a manuscript (as we’re doing right now) the writer would be working closer to the nature of the multiplied result, and through an increasing awareness and gradual mastery of the form’s new limitations and possibilities *the writing itself would evolve;* the shorter the distance between the raw material of words and their processed output, the more entwined the content and form from the outset. This line of thinking was more famously expounded by Benjamin in his 1936 essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,’ which more broadly argues that an authentic, pertinent art is the result of engagement with the latest technological innovations.” — <a href="http://www.servinglibrary.org/journal/3/letter-and-spirit">Dexter Sinister: Letter &amp; Spirit</a></p>

<p>The “Plaque Découpée Universelle” a
modular stencil device1
, from around 1879.</p>
<p>1936: Oswald Coopers Experiment “15 Serifs”</p>
<p>1959: Paul de Casteljau developed what was
later known as Bézier curves using de
Casteljau’s algorithm. The ideas there are
based on were widely publicized in 1962
by the French engineer Pierre Bézier, who
used them to design automobile bodies.6 7
They were a primer part for the later</p>
<p>1965: Hell’s 50T1 Digiset, the fi rst digital
typesetter, was made commercially
available.
1968: DigiGrotesk was one of the fi rst
commercially available digital fonts and
was designed in seven weights from light
to bold by the Hell Design Studio.

<p>1975: IKARUS from URW in Hamburg
programmed by Peter Karow was introduced at the ATypI in Warsaw. At the
beginning it was primarily used to digitize
analog letters and not so much for actually
drawing type itself. To do that a digitizer
tablet and a puck was used to mark a

point on all the curves at around every
30°. Further adjustments to every letter
could then be made on a screen. One
advantage of Ikarus was that it could
save lots of letters in a big database.
Ikarus later supported interpolation,
and could create a rounded and shaded
version of a typeface. It was used for the
digitalization of letters in a bigger scale.16
At the end of the same year Linotype
stopped to produce metal type setters.17</p>
<p>1977:
Franklin C. Crow developed one of the
fi rst practical solutions for the anti-aliasing
problem.</p>
<p>1977–1979
Donald Knuth developed his fi rst version
of his layout engine TeX together with the
font design engine Metafont (reworked
in 1984). It is a scripting based system for
desktop publishing and font creation. It
has a pen and an outlined model (page
26). Could the interpreter back then only
output bitmap fonts it is now also possible
to use Metatype1 and produce PostScript
fonts.
• All those programs and</p>
<p>1980:</p>
<p>Plotr by Petr van Blokland used the URW
Ikarus algorithm. It was the starting point
for the later program Pika that would run
on MacOS.20
• It later got sold to URW and was the
foundation for MacIKARUS (Ikarus M) and
later FontMaster.</p>
<p>1981
Bitstream was founded by Mike Parker,
the head of Mergenthaler’s font design
activity, that had left ITC taking with him
three colleagues including the type designer
Matthew Carter his former Linotype
colleague.21
They are the fi rst to call themselves a
digital type foundry.
“Through Bitstream, Carter and Parker
proposed to license digital typeface designs
to typesetting equipment manufacturers, a
revolutionary step in detaching the activity
of designing digital fonts from that of
building the machines upon which to set
those fonts.”22
Emily King, New Faces – Type design in the fi rst
decade of device-independent digital typesetting
(1987-1997), PhD Thesis (Chapter Three: The East
Coast – Matthew Carter)</p>
<p>May 1991
“The cost of the licensing was considered
very high at this time, and Adobe
continued to stonewall on more attractive
rates. It was this issue that led Apple
to design their own system, TrueType,
around 1991. [TrueType was released with
the launch of Mac OS System 7 in
May 1991 and later in March 1992 in
Windows 3.1.] Immediately following the
announcement of TrueType, Adobe
published the specifi cation for Type 1 font
format. Retail tools such as Altsys
Fontographer (on January 1995 acquired by
Macromedia, owned by FontLab since
May 2005) added the ability to create
Type 1 fonts. Since then, many free Type
1 fonts have been released; for instance,
many of the fonts used with the TeX
typesetting system are available in this
format.”47</p>
<p>1992:
Apple introduced Advanced Typography
(AAT) with Multiple master fonts.
These are “Type 1 font programs that
include two or more “master” fonts
within a single font fi le. It allows users to
interpolate many intermediate “instances”
of the typeface. The fonts have one
or more “axes” which might typically
represent the weight,width, or optical size
of the font.”48
• Seen as to unpractical it was widely
adopted and used.</p>
<h1>The relationship of type with tools</h1>
<p>This does not cover the development of the shape of letterforms, but rather focuses on the intricate relationship between type design and the tools that enable them, especially digital type.
