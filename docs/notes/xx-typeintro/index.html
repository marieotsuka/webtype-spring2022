		<h1>Introduction to Type</h1>
		<p><blockquote>
<p>“By writing directly into a mechanical form rather than a manuscript (as we’re doing right now) the writer would be working closer to the nature of the multiplied result, and through an increasing awareness and gradual mastery of the form’s new limitations and possibilities *the writing itself would evolve;* the shorter the distance between the raw material of words and their processed output, the more entwined the content and form from the outset. This line of thinking was more famously expounded by Benjamin in his 1936 essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,’ which more broadly argues that an authentic, pertinent art is the result of engagement with the latest technological innovations.” — <a href="http://www.servinglibrary.org/journal/3/letter-and-spirit">Dexter Sinister: Letter &amp; Spirit</a></p>

<p>The “Plaque Découpée Universelle” a<br>
modular stencil device1<br>
, from around 1879.</p>
<p>1936: Oswald Coopers Experiment “15 Serifs”</p>
<p>1959: Paul de Casteljau developed what was<br>
later known as Bézier curves using de<br>
Casteljau’s algorithm. The ideas there are<br>
based on were widely publicized in 1962<br>
by the French engineer Pierre Bézier, who<br>
used them to design automobile bodies.6 7<br>
They were a primer part for the later</p>
<p>1965: Hell’s 50T1 Digiset, the fi rst digital<br>
typesetter, was made commercially<br>
available.<br>
1968: DigiGrotesk was one of the fi rst<br>
commercially available digital fonts and<br>
was designed in seven weights from light<br>
to bold by the Hell Design Studio.<br>

<p>1975: IKARUS from URW in Hamburg<br>
programmed by Peter Karow was introduced at the ATypI in Warsaw. At the<br>
beginning it was primarily used to digitize<br>
analog letters and not so much for actually<br>
drawing type itself. To do that a digitizer<br>
tablet and a puck was used to mark a<br>

point on all the curves at around every<br>
30°. Further adjustments to every letter<br>
could then be made on a screen. One<br>
advantage of Ikarus was that it could<br>
save lots of letters in a big database.<br>
Ikarus later supported interpolation,<br>
and could create a rounded and shaded<br>
version of a typeface. It was used for the<br>
digitalization of letters in a bigger scale.16<br>
At the end of the same year Linotype<br>
stopped to produce metal type setters.17</p>
<p>1977:<br>
Franklin C. Crow developed one of the<br>
fi rst practical solutions for the anti-aliasing<br>
problem.</p>
<p>1977–1979<br>
Donald Knuth developed his fi rst version<br>
of his layout engine TeX together with the<br>
font design engine Metafont (reworked<br>
in 1984). It is a scripting based system for<br>
desktop publishing and font creation. It<br>
has a pen and an outlined model (page<br>
26). Could the interpreter back then only<br>
output bitmap fonts it is now also possible<br>
to use Metatype1 and produce PostScript<br>
fonts.<br>
• All those programs and</p>
<p>1980:</p>
<p>Plotr by Petr van Blokland used the URW<br>
Ikarus algorithm. It was the starting point<br>
for the later program Pika that would run<br>
on MacOS.20<br>
• It later got sold to URW and was the<br>
foundation for MacIKARUS (Ikarus M) and<br>
later FontMaster.</p>
<p>1981<br>
Bitstream was founded by Mike Parker,<br>
the head of Mergenthaler’s font design<br>
activity, that had left ITC taking with him<br>
three colleagues including the type designer<br>
Matthew Carter his former Linotype<br>
colleague.21<br>
They are the fi rst to call themselves a<br>
digital type foundry.<br>
“Through Bitstream, Carter and Parker<br>
proposed to license digital typeface designs<br>
to typesetting equipment manufacturers, a<br>
revolutionary step in detaching the activity<br>
of designing digital fonts from that of<br>
building the machines upon which to set<br>
those fonts.”22<br>
Emily King, New Faces – Type design in the fi rst<br>
decade of device-independent digital typesetting<br>
(1987-1997), PhD Thesis (Chapter Three: The East<br>
Coast – Matthew Carter)</p>
<p>May 1991<br>
“The cost of the licensing was considered<br>
very high at this time, and Adobe<br>
continued to stonewall on more attractive<br>
rates. It was this issue that led Apple<br>
to design their own system, TrueType,<br>
around 1991. [TrueType was released with<br>
the launch of Mac OS System 7 in<br>
May 1991 and later in March 1992 in<br>
Windows 3.1.] Immediately following the<br>
announcement of TrueType, Adobe<br>
published the specifi cation for Type 1 font<br>
format. Retail tools such as Altsys<br>
Fontographer (on January 1995 acquired by<br>
Macromedia, owned by FontLab since<br>
May 2005) added the ability to create<br>
Type 1 fonts. Since then, many free Type<br>
1 fonts have been released; for instance,<br>
many of the fonts used with the TeX<br>
typesetting system are available in this<br>
format.”47</p>
<p>1992:<br>
Apple introduced Advanced Typography<br>
(AAT) with Multiple master fonts.<br>
These are “Type 1 font programs that<br>
include two or more “master” fonts<br>
within a single font fi le. It allows users to<br>
interpolate many intermediate “instances”<br>
of the typeface. The fonts have one<br>
or more “axes” which might typically<br>
represent the weight,width, or optical size<br>
of the font.”48<br>
• Seen as to unpractical it was widely<br>
adopted and used.</p>
<h1>The relationship of type with tools</h1>
<p>This does not cover the development of the shape of letterforms, but rather focuses on the intricate relationship between type design and the tools that enable them, especially digital type.
