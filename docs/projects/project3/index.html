<p>“Technology inherits the politics of its authors, but almost all technology can be harnessed in ways that transcend these frameworks. Even in its harmful and chaotic state, it is still possible to marvel at the opportunities afforded to us through design.” – Cade Diem</p>

<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you will design and develop a simple tool that operates on the web: one that considers the values its built upon, and questions common expectations about how we behave.</p>
<p>To return to <a href="%2200-webintro.md%22">Munari’s quote</a> from our first class, artists are equipped to harness technology and repurpose them for their own means. Whether it is the mechanics of the web browser, of variable fonts, or other tools, there are ways to harness these to challenge conventions and reimagine expected results.</p>
<p>Digital tools today are often designed for a general purpose: maximum engagement and data extraction, driven by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html">surveillance capitalism</a>.
For our project, however, we will design the a web-based tool with a focused purpose in mind — and curate our visual and interactive palette accordingly. This web tool may not necessarily be practical or functional; however, it should be driven by a specific context or point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your audience?</li>
<li>What matters to you? To your visitors?</li>
<li>How can you encourage meaningful behavior?</li>
<li>How do you design an experience?</li>
<li>What options do we have? What are our defaults? What are our limits?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may find a way to incorporate your variable font in this project as well, if this site touches on a similar theme.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand how platforms and tools operate on a set of assumptions</li>
<li>Shape your visual voice in that aligns with the concept and purpose of the tool</li>
<li>Focus on interactivity and your relationship with the website visitor as a curated experience</li>
<li>Consider the context for your website visitor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider the responsibility of the tool — what is it enabling?</li>
<li>Pay careful attention to how your design and typography is navigating the user (or not)</li>
<li>Incorporate JavaScript — there should be some form of input, whether user input (click/hover/scroll/drag/etc) and / or external data sources (whether live or static)</li>
<li>It must be responsive (unless, in its concept, it must work only on desktop)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<pre><code>April 22
Pseudo code, design, begin prototype
- Write out your pseudo code: break down your tool scenario(s) into small steps. This will inform your JavaScript code.
- Design the interface for interaction
- Begin experimenting with your main interaction in code

April 29
Develop full prototype
- Complete develop your website as much as possible
- Pay careful attention to the “affordances” of your design

May 6
Test and refine prototype
- Collaborate with your group to provide detailed feedback
- Refine your site behavior

May 13
Final Crit
- Distribute your tool to the public
